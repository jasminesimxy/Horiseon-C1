# Module-1-Challenge

User Story:
As a marketing agency,
I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards
So that our own site is optimised for search engines

Acceptance Criteria:
Given a webpage meets accessibility standards,
when I view the source code
then i find semantic html elements

when i view that structure of the html elements,
then i find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

when I view the icon and image elements
then I find accessible alt attributes

when i view the heading attributes
then they fall in sequential order

when i view the title element
then i find a concise, descriptive title.
