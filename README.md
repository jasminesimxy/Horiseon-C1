# <HORISEON-C1>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

My motivation for this project was to understand and apply my new knowledge of HTML elements, logical structure of a HTML positioning, accessible alt attributes, sequential order into the incorrect/incomplete existing code.
I build this project because I want it to be readable for visually impaired individual who requires a screen reader to help them with the website. There were a few minor error with the HTML elements, the sequential order and attributes, which can impact the flow of the website for the screenreader.
The problem has solved the issues with how the website is structured for for the screenreader for the visually impaired individual to listen to. 
I've learnt a bit more about HTML elements, accesibility standards, logical structure of website, image alt attributes, sequential order of a HTML page.
